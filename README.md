# Data-Warehouse-to-store-data-on-Ethiopian-medical-data-# Ethiopian Medical Business Data Warehouse


 This project involves building a robust data warehouse for Ethiopian medical businesses by scraping data from the web and Telegram channels. The data warehouse enables efficient data analysis and enhances decision-making through structured data storage and integration of object detection capabilities using YOLO (You Only Look Once).

## Business Need
A well-designed data warehouse is crucial for storing, processing, and analyzing data effectively. By centralizing data, we can:
- Identify trends, patterns, and correlations in Ethiopian medical businesses.
- Improve decision-making with actionable intelligence.
- Enable efficient querying and reporting for business insights.

## Project Goals
This project consists of the following key components:
1. **Develop data scraping and collection pipeline** – Extract data from Telegram channels and web sources.
2. **Develop data cleaning and transformation pipeline** – Process and refine data for consistency.
3. **Object detection using YOLO** – Enhance analysis by detecting key objects in images.
4. **Data warehouse design and implementation** – Store structured data for efficient querying.
5. **Data integration and enrichment** – Combine and enhance data for comprehensive insights.

## Technology Stack
- **Web Scraping**: Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, Selenium
- **Object Detection**: YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- **ETL/ELT Processes**: Pandas, Apache Airflow
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL
- **Data Warehouse Design**: Star and Snowflake Schema
- **Data Integration**: API development, Data Pipelines
- **Security**: Role-based access control, Data encryption
